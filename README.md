A quick mod of Oclock Vita that defaults to maximum performance, useful for Vita TV/PS TV where there is no real downside in doing so. Hopefully settings are added to the original Oclock which obsolete the need for this, but for now it is good enough.

# Oclock Vita
taiHEN plugin for overclocking your PSVita

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put "oclockvita.suprx" in 'tai' folder in the root of your Vita.

Change config.txt in that directory to load plugin for title of your choice by adding new lines like below:

```text
# titleid for your game (this one is for Root//Letter for example)
*PCSB01019
ux0:tai/oclockvita.suprx
```

After that just run the game and press SELECT + UP to enable menu. Press SELECT + DOWN to close menu.
